          <h2>Early Life</h2></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>Vincent Fauci was born in Brooklyn, NY to Harry (Aurelio) and Marie (Martines) Fauci. His father was a plumber and his mother sewed piecework (ties) in their basement. She used to quiz Vince on spelling and math while she worked at her sewing
            machine. He did very well in school, graduating at the top of his class from elementary school (8th grade), which granted him admission to <a href="http://bths.edu/school_history.jsp">Brooklyn Technical High School</a>. He had a younger cousin
            that he accompanied to many Dodgers' games. He loved baseball and he loved the Brooklyn Dodgers seeing many of the greats play like Joe Dimaggio and Jackie Robinson. At the age of 18 he lost his father to lung cancer and became responsible
            for caring for his mother and younger sister. He attended college at night while working during the day but WWII had started. He was able to get deferments until his sister turned 18 but at 20 years old, in August 1943, he was drafted.

          <h2>World War II</h2></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>Upon entry into the army he excelled in an intelligence test and was assigned to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Specialized_Training_Program">Army Specialized Training Program</a>. However, more soldiers were needed for combat
            so the program terminated and the students were sent into combat. He served in the U.S. Army 100th Infantry, 398th Regiment and was injured in action in France in early 1945. Here is an excerpt from an interview with the Veterans' History
            Project:
            <blockquote class="quote">"We were training for deployment overseas. It was a 3-month training program at Fort Bening and then we were shipped in convoy to Europe. I can remember the boat ride; we were aboard ship for 22 days. I thought I was in the Navy instead of
              the Army. Believe it or not, I never got seasick. And the reason it took 22 days is because we had to take a meandering route to avoid submarines and we went through the straights of Gibraltar, through the Mediterranean, across the coast
              of North Africa, and then across the Mediterranean to Southern France. Our division landed in Marseille and we walked up the, I think it was the Rhone River Valley to Alsace Loraine where the battle was. We ran into a few skirmishes along
              the way. By that time, it was the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge and we didn’t know where we were. And this was I guess in late 1945. I know during those battles I was wounded and sent back to Paris for surgery. From Paris I was shipped
              to South Hampton, England. And from that time and the date I was wounded, I guess was January of 1945, because I spent eleven months in various hospitals in France, England and the U.S. Finally when I was discharged from the U.S. I was reassigned
              to special services, which was responsible for all camp entertainment. I was reassigned as an entertainment specialist and like the army, you're never assigned into anything where you had any experience."</blockquote>

          <h2>Warner-Lambert</h2></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>After receiving the Purple Heart, he returned home to Long Island and attended college on the GI Bill. Vince received a degree in Chemistry from Adelphi University and began working at Warner Lambert Corporation while he was still in school.
            Starting on the research bench, he rose in the company and worked on a variety of products including cosmetics, bromo-seltzer and other consumer pharmeceuticals. He held research, managerial, and executive positions at Warner-Lambert/Parke
            Davis for 35 years, retiring in 1985. He was well-respected throughout the company. Particularly touching was the presence of a man who was working under him in 1985 at Vince's funeral in 2013. The man said he had seen the obituary in the
            paper and wanted to pay his respects to the best boss he ever had. </p>

          <h2>Personal/Civic Life</h2></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>Vince met his sweetheart Grace at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner–Lambert">Warner-Lambert</a>. He was a manager at the plant and she worked on one of the packaging lines. They were both over 35 when they married. Unable to achieve
            pregnancy, they fostered children for a number of years until adopting a girl when Vince was 44 and a year and a half later a boy. Vince always kept on learning, signing up for night and adjunct classes in a range of areas from business administration
            to how to raise sheep. Although a city boy, Vince fell in love with Lancaster and Lebanon counties, becoming active in farmland conservation and served in a number of civic organizations including the Lititz, PA planning commission. An active
            Catholic he was a member of the Knights of Columbus and served on many committees within the church, including the eucharistic and finance committees, at St. James in Lititz, Mary Gate of Heaven in Myerstown and Our Lady of Fatima, Jonestown.
            He often expressed his thankfulness to God for all his blessings.</p>

          <h2>Veteran's History Project Interview</h2></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>At 86 years old, Vince was interviewed by high school students for the Library of Congress' Veteran's History Project. He had always been slow to talk about the horrors that he saw and participated in, this interview is no different. Being an eternal optimist he always chose to focus on any good he could find.  To sum up his experience in the war, "It builds character." He is listed as a recipient of a <a href="http://marshallfoundation.org/100th-infantry/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/Appendix_Awards_and_Decorations.pdf">Bronze Star</a> (the entire division due to the valor at the Bulge) but this was done a number of years after the war and he never knew it. During the interview he also talks about growing up in Brooklyn and Long Island. Below is the students' video:</p>
